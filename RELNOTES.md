This is a new version of the API.
The tweaked version of Gorgonia have been removed. It is now compatible with the master branch of Gorgonia.
Some operators are not yet available though.

Meanwhile, you can use the old version for a demo by fetching a pre-release version of checking out the old version `01b2e2b`
